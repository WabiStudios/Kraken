 * A custom build, carefully tailored to the needs of the
 * Kraken software project, where it is used as a foundational
 * component framework in the context of a Digital Content
 * Creation Platform. Changes were made to better establish
 * Universal Scene Description for expanded use as the central
 * primary architecture -- rather than for a supplementary role.
 *
 * Capabilities expanded, yet, ensuring it stays consistent and
 * interoperable with Pixar's current Release branch. Additional
 * focus spent on cross-platform interoperability, where Microsoft
 * Windows support was lacking, and maintaining consistency with
 * Linux. And expanding the graphics capabilities of the graphics
 * & imaging APIs, such as Phoenix -- the real-time render engine,
 * and Hydra Engine/Rendering API improvements.
 *
 * The main focus areas on animation toolkits, skel rigging, 2D
 * animation authored and edited with scene description, and
 * expansive procedural node-based workflows.
